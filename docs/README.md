# Kibanalytics

[[toc]]

This project aims to make use of the [ELK stack](https://www.elastic.co/what-is/elk-stack) to collect events from web pages and visualize them, offering the same kind of insights that [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/) does.

The reason behind this project is to provide an alternative to GA, that offers data ownership, adblocker avoidance, powerful aggregations, grained filtering and big data storage.
