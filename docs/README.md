# Kibanalytics

This project aims to make use of the [ELK stack](https://www.elastic.co/what-is/elk-stack) to collect events from web
pages and visualize them, offering the same kind of insights
that [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/) does.

The reason behind this project is to provide an alternative to GA, that offers data ownership, adblocker avoidance,
powerful aggregations, grained filtering and big data storage.
